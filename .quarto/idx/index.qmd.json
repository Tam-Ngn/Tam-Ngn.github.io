During my time here, I have had the pleasure to meet people from all walks of life and learned to live life the way I didn't before.\n\n## **Education**\n\n**Macalester College \\| St. Paul MN**\n\n**B.A. in Statistics and Computer Science \\| Sept 2020 - May 2024**\n\n\\\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","page-footer":{"left":"&copy; Tam Nguyen Hoang, 2023<br>\nAll content licensed under <i class='bi-badge-cc'></i>\n[(CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n","right":"Site built with <a href='https://quarto.org/'>Quarto</a>\n"},"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Tam Hoang Nguyen","about":{"id":"intro-heading","template":"trestles","image":"images/profile_pic.jpg","links":[{"icon":"github","href":"https://github.com/Tam-Ngn"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
