During my time here, I have had the pleasure to meet people from all walks of life, found love, got burned but above all that, I learned to live my life the way I didn’t before.\n## Education\nMacalester College | St. Paul MN <br>\nB.A. in Statistics and Computer Science | Sept 2020 - May 2024\n:::\n\n\n### This content appears below the formatted about page content."
